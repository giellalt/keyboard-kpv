This repository contains source files for
keyboards for the Komi-Zyrian language. The code
is licensed under the LGPLv3 license, and the license is
also detailed in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. The authors named
in the AUTHORS file are available for other licensing options.

Documentation:

- [Language specific documentation](https://giellalt.github.io/keyboard-kpv)
- [Keyboard development](https://giellalt.github.io/keyboards/Overview.html)

The plan is to submit the layout definitions to [CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org)
where they will become available for OS developers.

## Requirements

- [kbdgen](https://github.com/divvun/kbdgen)

## Getting the source

The Komi-Zyrian keyboard sources can be acquired using the Fork or Code
buttons on this page.

## Building desktop keyboards

To build desktop keyboards, do as follows:

```sh
./configure
make
```

iOS, Android and ChromeOS keyboards have additional requirements, and are best
handled by the preconfigured CI/CD system in the GiellaLT infrastructure. If
you want to play on your own, please have a look at the
[`kbdgen` documentation](https://github.com/divvun/kbdgen).
